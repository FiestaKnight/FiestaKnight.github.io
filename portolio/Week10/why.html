                <p>The original <i>Rivals of Aether</i> was one of the games I played a lot to connect with a dear friend of mine over in Sweden which makes it hold a special place in my heart.</p>
                <p>I would mostly play Etalus and guest character Shovel Knight, who both are not in the current game roster, while my other friend would play basically the rest of the cast.</p>
                <p>We mostly stuck to playing with each other opposed to with strangers and that time spent was always a blast!</p>
