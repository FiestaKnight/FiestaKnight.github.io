                <h1>Learn More About Izak Nielsen</h1>


<p>With the goal of one day working in the Video game industry an <em>Associate Degree in Software Development</em> seemed like a no brainer and it helped that the more work I did the more I loved coding. Year one took more time to focus on the client-side technologies while the second-year was more server-side languages.</p>


<p>For <strong>2 and ½ years</strong>, I trained my understanding of the ins and outs of programs such as <i>C#</i> to <i>Unity</i> at <i>The College of Western Idaho</i>. Outside of that I’ve been actively looking in and communicating in the <i>D3v Central Station</i> and <i>Game Production Community discord</i> servers where developers both new and old talk about everything that goes into making a game.</p>
