                <h1>Learn More About Izak Nielsen</h1>

<p>Growing up in Idaho for most of my life, with a small amount of time spent in Illinois, but with my whole life ahead of me <br>I'm more than happy to move where needed!</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>With the goal of one day working in the Video game industry an <em>Associate Degree in Software Development</em> seemed like a no brainer and it helped that the more work I did the more I loved coding. Semester one took more time to focus on the client-side technologies while the second-year was more server-side languages.</p>


<p>For <strong>2 and ½ years</strong>, I trained my understanding of the ins and outs of programs such as <i>C#</i> to <i>Unity</i> at <i>The College of Western Idaho</i>. Outside of that I’ve been actively looking in and communicating in the <i>D3v Central Station</i> and <i>Game Production Community discord</i> servers where developers both new and old talk about everything that goes into making a game.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>If it wasn't obvious enough I do enjoy partaking in the activity known as Video games with such games as <i>Kirby Super Star</i>, <i>Team Fortress 2</i> and <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> being some of my favorites. These experiences have me wanting to make something of my very own, even now running a <i>D&D</i> game with some close friends of mine to understand what makes a game fun. </p>
